/*Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search.
 If k doesn't exist in arr[] return -1. 
Note: If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.*/
