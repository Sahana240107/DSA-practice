/*Pairs and vectors can be used together to achieve some amazing results. Here we will learn to use a vector that holds pairs.
You are given a vector V of size n. The vector hold pair of integers. Example V={(1,2),(3,4)...}. Now, you need to sum the second elements.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
vector -> {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6),(7, 8), (9, 10)}
Output: 
30*/
