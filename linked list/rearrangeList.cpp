/*Given a linked list, you have to perform the following task:

Extract the alternative nodes starting from the second node.
Reverse the extracted list.
Append the extracted list at the end of the original list.
Note: Try to solve the problem without using any extra memory.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 10->4->9->1->3->5->9->4
Output: 10->9->3->9->4->5->1->4

Explanation: Alternative nodes in the given linked list are 4,1,5,4.
 Reversing the alternative nodes from the given list, and then appending 
 them to the end of the list results in a list 10->9->3->9->4->5->1->4.*/
