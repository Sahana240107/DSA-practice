/*You are given an array, arr[]. Find the minimum index based distance between two distinct elements of the array, x and y. Return -1, if either x or y does not exist in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 2], x = 1, y = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: x = 1 and y = 2. There are two distances between x and y, which are 1 and 3 out of which the least is 1.
