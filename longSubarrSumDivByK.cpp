/*Given an array arr[] and a positive integer k, find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of the elements divisible by k.
Note: If there is no subarray with sum divisible by k, then return 0.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 7, 6, 1, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarray [7, 6, 1, 4] has sum = 18, which is divisible by 3.
