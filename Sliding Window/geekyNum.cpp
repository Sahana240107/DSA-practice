/*Geek just learned about Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

He defines a new series called Geeky numbers. Here the next number is the sum of the K preceding numbers.
You are given an array of size K, GeekNum[ ], where the ith element of the array represents the ith Geeky number. Return its Nth term.

Input:
N = 5, K = 3
GeekNum[] = {0, 1, 2}
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
Terms are 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.
So the 5th term is 6
