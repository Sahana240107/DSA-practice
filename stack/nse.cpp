/*You are given an integer array arr[ ]. For every element in the array, your task is to determine its Next Smaller Element (NSE).


The Next Smaller Element (NSE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the right of x in the array and is strictly smaller than x.

If no such element exists, assign -1 as the NSE for that position.
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 8, 5, 2, 25]
Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1]
Explanation: 
The first element smaller than 4 having index > 0 is 2.
The first element smaller than 8 having index > 1 is 5.
The first element smaller than 5 having index > 2 is 2.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 3.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 4.
