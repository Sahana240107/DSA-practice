/*You are given an integer array arr[ ]. For every element in the array, your task is to determine its Previous Smaller Element (PSE).

The Previous Smaller Element (PSE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the left of x in the array and is strictly smaller than x.

Note: If no such element exists, assign -1 as the PSE for that position.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2]
Output: [-1, 1, 1]
Explanation:
For 1, there is no element on the left, so answer is -1.
For 6, previous smaller element is 1.
For 2, previous smaller element is 1.
