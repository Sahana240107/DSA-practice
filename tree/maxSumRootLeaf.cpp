/*Given a Binary Tree, find the maximum sum path from a leaf to root.


Example 1:

Input:
        1
       / \
      2   3 
Output:
4
Explanation: 
Following the path 3 -> 1, results in a
sum of 4, which is the maximum path sum
from leaf to root for the given tree.
Example 2:

Input:
       10
      /  \
    -2    7
    / \   
   8  -4    
Output:
17
Explanation : 
Following the path 7 -> 10, results in a
sum of 17, which is the maximum path sum
from leaf to root for the given tree.
