/*Given a sorted array, arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point, i.e., the first index where 1 was observed, and before that, only 0 was observed.  
If arr does not have any 1, return -1. If array does not have any 0, return 0.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: index 3 is the transition point where 1 begins.*/
