/* Minimum k to Make Array Non-Positive

You are given a positive integer array nums.

For a positive integer k, define nonPositive(nums, k) as the minimum number of operations needed to make every element of nums non-positive. In one operation, you can choose an index i and reduce nums[i] by k.

Return the minimum value of k such that nonPositive(nums, k) ≤ k².

Example 1
Input: nums = [3, 7, 5]
Output: 3

Example 2
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1*/
