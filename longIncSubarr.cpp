/*Given an array arr[] of integers. The problem is finding the longest contiguous subarray's length such that every element is strictly greater than its previous element in the same subarray.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: here the subarray arr[2:6] = [3, 5, 7, 8, 9] is longest subarray to follow strictly increasing order.*/
